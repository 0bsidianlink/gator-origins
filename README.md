# Fun Website Starter

Woohoo, time for your first project! 

Once you make your own repository using this as a template, go get into it and start building! No pressure, just build something you like and you'll end up learning stuff along the way trust me. 

Not to mention, **welcome to GitHub**! This is a great tool and place for you to put the code you've worked on out in the public so you can look back on everything you've built. GitHub also provides free hosting for projects too, which we'll be taking advantage of.

Git and Github sound similar but they're actually a little different:
* Git is a version control system (VCS) that tracks your files and changes to them, so that it's easy for multiple people to work on the same code together without conflicts. 
* GitHub is just a site where people can upload their repositories (pretty much fancy name for "folder where all your code for a project is") and other people can download and work off them. Think like Google Drive online.

After you make your own repo using this as a template, you can go ahead and start editing files!

* `index.html` should have all your html DOM and web elements. It's the bones of the site.
* `main.js` should have the javascript that works with the DOM to do cool stuff like change colors or move stuff around. It's the muscles of the site.
* `styles.css` should have the CSS that makes the site look cool (this is probably the most fun to play with but also it can be really weird lol). It'd be like the cool shiny scales of the website.

Then when you're done, commit those changes and push them back up to github to check the hosted version of the site! You can also open the index.html file locally in your browser to test out changes first :).
