<p class="another">yeah i know about the "undefined" thing i can't quite figure out how to fix that yet<br> yeah i'd like to make this into a little program sometime, maybe something where you can do a bit more like choose the pokemon picture and have the name show up in the box, maybe even an export to image thing or something i don't quite know yet. probably will have to change that textbox to something better because you can break it pretty easily i think lol. idk we'll see where i get with this <br> <br>I fixed the background so now you will not get a rave on spam click. oh shoot i should change the background to the pmd quiz opening. idk how that would work but that would be cool damn</p>

        <p class="cbt">Cock and ball torture from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia at en.wikipedia.org Cock and ball torture (CBT) is a sexual activity involving application of pain or constriction to the male genitals. This may involve directly painful activities, such as wax play, genital spanking, squeezing, ball busting, genital flogging, urethral play, tickle torture, erotic electrostimulation, or even kicking. The recipient of such activities may receive direct physical pleasure via masochism, knowledge that the play is pleasing to a sadistic dominant.<br>

            In Pornography<br>
            <br>
            In addition to its occasional role in BDSM pornography, Tamakeri (lit. ball kicking) is a seperate genre in Japan. One notable actress in tamakeri is Erika Nagai, who typically uses her martial arts skills knee or kick men in the testicles.<br>

            Ball stretcher<br>
            <br>
            A ball stretcher is a sex toy that is fastened around a man in order to elongate the scrotum and provide a feeling of weight pulling the testicles away from the body. While leather stretchers are most common, other models are made of steel rings that are fastened with screws, causing additional mildly uncomfortable weight to the wearer. The length of the stretcher may vary from 1-4 inches, and the steel models can weigh as much as 5 pounds.<br>
            <br>
            Parachute<br>
            <br>
            A parachute is a small collar, usually made from leather, which fastens around the scrotum, and from which weights can be hung. Conical in shape, with three or four short chains hanging beneath, to which weights can be attached. Used as part of cock and ball torture within a BDSM relationship, the parachute provides a constant drag, an squeezing effect on the man's testicles, moderate weights of 3-5 kg can be suspended, especially during bondage. Smaller weights can be used when the man is free to move, when the swinging effect of the weight can restrict sudden movements, as well as providing a visual stimulus for the dominant partner.<br>

            Humbler<br>
            <br>
            A humbler is a BDSM physical restraint device used to restrict the movement of a submissive male participant in a BDSM scene. The humbler consists of a testicle cuff device that clamps around the base of the scrotum, mounted in the center of a bar that passes behind the thighs at the base of the buttocks. This forces the wearer to keep his legs forward, as any attempt to straighten the legs even slightly pulls directly on the scrotum, causing from considerable discomfort to extreme pain.<br>
